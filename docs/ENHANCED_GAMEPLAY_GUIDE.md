## 📈 System 1: Progressive Difficulty Scaling

### How It Works

Difficulty increases gradually with each wave:

```
Wave  | Asteroid Count | Speed Mult | UFO Accuracy | Difficulty
------|---------------|------------|--------------|------------
1     | 4 base        | 1.0x       | 1.0x         | 1.0x
5     | 6 asteroids   | 1.2x       | 1.32x        | 1.4x
10    | 9 asteroids   | 1.45x      | 1.72x        | 1.9x
20    | 14 asteroids  | 1.95x      | 2.52x        | 2.9x
50    | 29 asteroids  | 3.0x (CAP) | 4.92x        | 5.9x
```

### Scaling Formulas

```python
# Asteroid Count
base_count = 4
wave_multiplier = min(1 + (wave - 1) * 0.5, 3.0)  # Caps at 3x
actual_count = int(base_count * wave_multiplier)

# Asteroid Speed
asteroid_speed_multiplier = 1.0 + (wave - 1) * 0.05  # +5% per wave

# UFO Accuracy
ufo_accuracy_multiplier = 1.0 + (wave - 1) * 0.08  # +8% per wave

# General Difficulty
difficulty_multiplier = 1.0 + (wave - 1) * 0.1  # +10% per wave
```

### Visual Indicators

- **Bottom left HUD**: `DIFFICULTY: x2.5` (color changes from yellow to red at 2x)
- **Boss warning**: Red alert one wave before boss encounter

---

## 👾 System 2: Boss Encounters

### Boss Waves

- **Frequency**: Every 5 waves (Wave 5, 10, 15, 20...)
- **Health Scaling**: `100 + (wave ÷ 5) × 50 HP`
  - Wave 5 Boss: 150 HP
  - Wave 10 Boss: 200 HP
  - Wave 20 Boss: 300 HP

### Boss Phases

Bosses have 3 escalating phases based on remaining health:

#### Phase 1 (100% - 66% Health)
- **Color**: Red
- **Shooting**: Triple shot pattern (every 40 frames)
- **Behavior**: Horizontal movement
- **Threat Level**: Medium

#### Phase 2 (66% - 33% Health)
- **Color**: Orange

### Boss Rewards

```
Base Score: 5,000 points

Extra Life: Granted on defeat

Wave 5 Boss:  7,000 points + 1 life
Wave 10 Boss: 9,000 points + 1 life
Wave 20 Boss: 13,000 points + 1 life
```

## 🐛 Debugging & Balance Notes

### Performance Optimizations

All new systems designed with 60 FPS maintenance:
- Boss uses simplified rendering
- Environmental events use efficient overlays
- Ally AI runs every frame but with simple logic
- Special bullets reuse base bullet rendering with color swaps

### Balance Tuning

```python
# Easy to adjust:
boss_wave_interval = 5          # Change to 3 for more bosses
event_chance = 0.15             # Increase for more chaos
ally_spawn_chance = 0.20        # Increase for more help
ammo_counts = {adjustable}      # Tune ammo availability

# Difficulty curve:
difficulty_multiplier = 1.0 + (wave - 1) * 0.1  # Adjust multiplier
wave_multiplier = min(1 + (wave - 1) * 0.5, 3)  # Adjust cap
```
